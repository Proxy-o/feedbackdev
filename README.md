This is a Next.js 15 template built with modern tools to speed up your development process. It integrates Shadcn for UI components, Tailwind CSS for styling, Drizzle as the TypeScript-first ORM, and NextAuth for authentication.

## Features

- **Next.js 15** - The latest features of Next.js with powerful, flexible API routes and components.
- **Shadcn** - Easily customizable and accessible UI components.
- **Tailwind CSS** - Rapidly build modern and responsive designs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Node.js** and **npm**  installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Proxy-o/Next.js15-Template-with-Shadcn-TailwindCSS-Drizzle-NextAuth
   cd nextjs-15-template
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   for me its better to use pnpm 
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and add the following environment variables:
```plaintext
# Authentication Secret
AUTH_SECRET="your_auth_secret_here"

# GitHub Authentication (NextAuth)
AUTH_GITHUB_ID="your_github_client_id"
AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET="your_github_client_secret"

# Database URL (using Drizzle with PostgreSQL)
DATABASE_URL="your_pg_link"
```

**Note**:
- Replace `your_auth_secret_here` with a secure random string for `AUTH_SECRET`.
- Replace `your_github_client_id` and `your_github_client_secret` with values from your GitHub OAuth application.
- Replace `your_pg_link`, with you link to db or you can use slqlite. 



4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
